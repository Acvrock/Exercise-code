President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday tweeted a New Year's message to his supporters and his "many enemies."

"Happy New Year to all, including to my many enemies and those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don't know what to do. Love!" Trump wrote.


Trump takes office on January 20, 2017. The president-elect has continued to tweet throughout the transition period, frequently criticizing Democrats, party nominee Hillary Clinton and President Barack Obama.

On Friday, Trump tweeted praise for Russian President Vladimir Putin, after Obama announced a new round of sanctions over Russian interference in the presidential election.

The incoming White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, has indicated that Trump will continue to use social media throughout his presidency.
